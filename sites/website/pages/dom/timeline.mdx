Create complex sequences of animations across multiple elements.

```javascript
import { timeline } from "motion"

timeline(sequence, options)
```

## Sequence

The timeline `sequence` is an array:

```javascript
const sequence = []
```

This sequence defines animations with the same settings as the [`animate`](/dom/animate) function:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
const sequence = [
  ["nav", { x: 100 }, { duration: 1 }]
];
```

By default, animations will play one after another:

```javascript
const sequence = [
  ["nav", { x: 100 }, { duration: 1 }],
  ["nav li", { opacity: 1 }, { duration: 0.3, delay: stagger(0.1) }],
]
```

### `at`

The timing of subsequent animations can be adjusted with the `at` option.

Pass a number to define a specific time:

```javascript
const sequence = [
  ["nav", { opacity: 1 }],
  // This will start 0.5 from the start of the whole timeline:
  ["nav", { x: 100 }, { at: 0.5 }],
]
```

Pass a string starting with `+` or `-` to start relative to the end of the previous animation:

```javascript
const sequence = [
  ["nav", { opacity: 1 }],
  // This will start 0.5 seconds after the previous animation:
  ["nav", { x: 100 }, { at: "+0.5" }],
  // This will start 0.2 seconds before the end of the previous animation:
  ["nav li", { opacity: 1 }, { at: "-0.2" }],
]
```

Or pass `"<"` starting with `+` or `-` to start relative to the end of the previous animation:

```javascript
const sequence = [
  ["nav", { opacity: 1 }, { duration: 1 }],
  ["nav", { x: 100 }, { duration: 1 }],
  // This will start at the same time as the x: 100 animation
  ["nav li", { opacity: 1 }, { at: "<" }],
]
```

## Options

### `duration`

**Default:** Automatically calculated

A duration, in seconds, that the animation will take to complete.

```javascript
timeline(sequence, { duration: 4 })
```

By default, this is automatically calculated by the provided sequence. But if provided explicitly, the whole animation will be scaled to fit this duration.

### `delay`

**Default:** `0`

A duration, in seconds, that the animation will be delayed before starting.

```javascript
timeline(sequence, { delay: 0.5 })
```

### `endDelay`

**Default:** `0`

A duration, in seconds, that the animation will wait at the end before ending.

```javascript
timeline(sequence, { endDelay: 0.5 })
```

### `direction`

**Default:** `"normal"`

The direction of animation playback. `"normal"`, `"reverse"`, `"alternate"`, or `"alternate-reverse"`.

```javascript
timeline(sequence, { direction: "alternate", repeat: 2 })
```

### `repeat`

**Default:** `0`

The number of times the animation should repeat. Set to `Infinity` to repeat indefinitely.

```javascript
timeline(sequence, { repeat: 2 })
```

### `defaultOptions`

An object of options to use as the default `options` for each animation in the sequence.

```javascript
timeline(sequence, {
  defaultOptions: { ease: "ease-in-out" },
})
```

## Returns

`timeline` returns [animation controls](/dom/controls)
